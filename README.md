# Thrombosis Diagnosis Analysis
This repository contains an in-depth analysis of thrombosis diagnosis using various data science and machine learning techniques. The goal is to develop predictive models and gain insights into the factors that contribute to thrombosis.

## Introduction
Thrombosis is a serious medical condition where blood clots form in blood vessels, potentially leading to life-threatening complications. This project aims to analyze the factors leading to thrombosis and build predictive models to aid in early diagnosis.

## Data
The dataset used in this analysis includes various medical records and patient information relevant to thrombosis. It includes features such as age, gender, medical history, lifestyle factors, and lab results.

## Methodology
The analysis follows these main steps:

- Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, data normalization, and encoding categorical variables.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing data distributions and relationships between features.
- Feature Engineering: Creating new features to improve model performance.
- Modeling: Applying various machine learning algorithms including logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and neural networks.
- Evaluation: Using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC to evaluate model performance.

## Results
The results section provides detailed findings from the data analysis and the performance of different models. Visualizations and statistical tests are included to highlight key insights and model efficacy.

## Conclusions
Summarizes the key takeaways from the analysis and the potential implications for medical practice. It also discusses limitations and suggestions for future research.
